Project-6: Thread

I thought this project was fun. I enjoyed watching the different threads work.

In parta I expected it to count to at least 4 giving each thread a chance to increment once.
In partb I expected all the threads to finish counting and I expected the count to be 40
I was somewhat confused when it only counted to 10 and as I watched it, each thread
seemed to have it's own version of count.
In partc I expected a quicker version of partb simply because we took out the wait,
but instead it ended up counting to 40 which I don't understand. It didn't do this until I
added the extra code in partd. 
Partd worked as expected because I knew it would count to 40.
