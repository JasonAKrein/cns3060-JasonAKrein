CNS 3060 Project - 5

I found parts of this project extremely difficult and unfortunately I got started on it late so I missed out on some points.

However I enjoyed certain aspect of this assignment, specifically learning about setattrs and using terminal attributes. 

I wish I had more time to work on it.
