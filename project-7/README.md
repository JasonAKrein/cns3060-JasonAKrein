Project 7a 

This project took me long enough that I didn't have time to get the extra credit. 

It was difficult making sure the signals were getting to the right place and the replies were correct.

I wasn't sure how to get the SIGUSR signals to work, finally looked online to found out the kill would do that.

I'm not sure how to get the makefile to cleanup. 

This is Jason Krein signing out.

I liked your class and I appreciated your efforts.
